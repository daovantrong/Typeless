TypeLess - Auto Form Filler Privacy Policy & Permission Justification

+ SINGLE PURPOSE:
Each extension must have a single purpose that is easy to understand and has a narrow scope.

The single purpose of TypeLess - Auto Form Filler is to automatically fill web forms with user-saved profiles. This includes saving form data, applying saved profiles to forms, and providing related utilities like form export, screenshot capture, and user agent switching to assist with form testing and development.

+ REASONS FOR REQUESTING PERMISSIONS:
Permissions are a list of strings identifying specific capabilities, such as "activeTab", or a pattern that matches granting access to one or more hosts.
Remove any permissions that are not necessary to fulfill the extension's single purpose. If your extension requests unnecessary permissions, this version will be rejected.

All permissions requested by TypeLess are essential for its core functionality and are used only for their intended purpose.

- storage:
Required to save user profiles, form data, language preferences, and extension settings locally on the device. Without this permission, users cannot save or retrieve their form profiles.

- activeTab:
Required to interact with form fields on the currently active webpage. This permission allows the extension to read and write form data only when the user explicitly activates it, ensuring no background monitoring of websites.

- scripting:
Required to inject the floating toolbar UI and execute form-filling scripts on web pages. This permission enables the core functionality of automatically filling forms with saved data.

- clipboardWrite:
Required to copy profile data to the system clipboard for sharing between browser tabs, devices, or for backup purposes. This allows users to export profiles for transfer.

- clipboardRead:
Required to import profile data from the system clipboard. This allows users to paste previously copied profiles or import data from external sources.

- contextMenus:
Required to add TypeLess options to the browser's right-click context menu. This provides quick access to profiles and tools without needing to open the extension popup.

- declarativeNetRequest:
Required to modify network requests for enhanced form functionality, such as user agent switching for testing different device behaviors. This enables advanced form testing capabilities.

- declarativeNetRequestWithHostAccess:
Required for extended network request handling that works with host permissions. This supports advanced form manipulation and mobile emulation features across all websites.

- downloads:
Required to download files generated by the extension, including HTML form exports for debugging, screenshots for documentation, and profile backups for data management.

- HOST PERMISSIONS:
Host permissions are any matching patterns specified in the "permissions" and "content_scripts" fields of the extension manifest file.
