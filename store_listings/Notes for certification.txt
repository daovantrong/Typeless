Purpose:
TypeLess is a comprehensive productivity extension designed to automate web form completion using locally stored profiles, smart data generation, and advanced form utilities. It serves developers, testers, shoppers, and professionals who frequently fill out forms online.

Privacy & Security:

- No External Servers: The extension does not communicate with any external servers, APIs, or cloud services.
- No Accounts Required: Reviewers do not need any external credentials or social media accounts to test the extension.
- No Background Activity: Extension only functions when explicitly activated by the user.
