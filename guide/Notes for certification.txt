TypeLess - Auto Form Filler: Certification Notes for Reviewers

Purpose:
TypeLess is a comprehensive productivity extension designed to automate web form completion using locally stored profiles, smart data generation, and advanced form utilities. It serves developers, testers, shoppers, and professionals who frequently fill out forms online.

Privacy & Security:
- 100% Local Storage: All user-defined data and profiles are stored exclusively on the user's device using the chrome.storage API.
- No External Servers: The extension does not communicate with any external servers, APIs, or cloud services.
- No Accounts Required: Reviewers do not need any external credentials or social media accounts to test the extension.
- No Background Activity: Extension only functions when explicitly activated by the user.

Key Features & Testing Steps:

1. Profile Management:
   - To test: Navigate to any website with a form (e.g., https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/forms/overview/), fill in some dummy data, click the extension icon, and select "Save Form".
   - Result: You can then rename (✏️ pencil button inline), delete, export, or import these profiles in the popup or in the "Profiles" tab of the Options page.
   - Inline Rename: Click the ✏️ button next to any profile name to edit it in place. Press Enter to confirm or Escape to cancel.

2. Auto-Fill Functionality:
   - Method 1: Click the extension popup icon and select a profile from the list
   - Method 2: Click the floating toolbar (bottom-right circle button) and select a profile
   - Method 4: Right-click on any page and select profiles from the context menu

3. Smart Fill (Mock Data):
   - To test: Click the lightning bolt icon (⚡) in the floating toolbar or the "Tools" tab.
   - Result: The extension will automatically detect empty fields and populate them with realistic placeholder data (Names, Emails, Phone numbers, Addresses, etc.).

4. Advanced Tools:

   Form Utilities:
   - Save HTML: Click "Save HTML" in the Tools tab to download the current form's DOM state for offline debugging.
   - Unlock Right-Click: Enable this in the Tools tab to bypass websites that disable the browser's context menu.
   - Screenshot Capture: Use "Screenshot Visible" or "Screenshot Full" to capture the current page. The toolbar is automatically hidden before capture and restored afterwards — screenshots will not include the TypeLess toolbar overlay.

   Mobile Emulation:
   - User Agent Switching: Change browser user agent to simulate mobile devices (Android/iOS)
   - Mobile Simulation: Accurate platform detection and touch simulation

   Data Management:
   - Export/Import: Use buttons in the Tools tab to backup or restore profiles via JSON files. The exported JSON (v1.2 format) includes metadata (version, export date, count) and supports all new field properties.
   - Import Result: The import notification now shows how many profiles were added, updated, and skipped separately.
   - Copy/Paste: Copy profiles to clipboard for sharing between tabs or machines.

9. FineUI / ComboBox Support:
   - TypeLess now detects FineUI DropDownList inputs (text inputs that act as dropdowns) and correctly saves both the display label and the internal code value.
   - When a profile is applied, both the visible text and the hidden code input are restored accurately.

10. Profile Manager (Options Page):
    - Open the Options page (gear icon) and navigate to the "Profiles" tab.
    - All saved profiles can be viewed, searched, and edited from this centralized manager.

5. Multi-Language Support:
   - Test by changing language in the Settings tab
   - Supported: English, Vietnamese, Chinese (Simplified), Traditional Chinese, Japanese, Korean
   - Interface and field labels dynamically translate

6. Keyboard Shortcuts:
   - Ctrl+Shift+H (Command+Shift+H on Mac): Toggle toolbar visibility

7. Accessibility:
   - Toolbar Toggle: Use Alt+Shift+H to hide or show the floating toolbar
   - Context Menu: Right-clicking any page allows access to profiles and tools
   - Responsive Design: Works on desktop and mobile browsers

8. Security Features:
   - Local Storage Only: All data stays on device
   - User-Initiated Actions: No automatic scanning or background processes
   - Transparent Permissions: Each permission clearly justified and minimal
   - No Data Transmission: Profiles never leave the browser
   - Sender Validation: chrome.runtime.onMessage listener verifies sender.id matches the extension's own ID before processing any message
   - Content Security Policy: script-src 'self'; object-src 'none'; base-uri 'none' — no inline scripts or remote code permitted

   Note on "all_frames: true" (content_scripts):
   TypeLess injects its content script into all iframes on a page. This is necessary because many real-world forms are embedded inside iframes (payment gateways, multi-step wizards, government portals, etc.). Without all_frames support, TypeLess would silently skip these embedded forms and fail to fill or save them.
   The content script does not perform any automatic scanning; it only activates when the user explicitly interacts with the extension toolbar, popup, or keyboard shortcut.

   Note on "clipboardRead" permission:
   This permission is used exclusively for the "Paste" button in the toolbar/popup, which allows users to restore a previously copied profile from their clipboard. The extension never reads the clipboard passively or without a direct user click.

   Note on "declarativeNetRequest" + "declarativeNetRequestWithHostAccess" permissions:
   These permissions power the User Agent Switching feature. When a user selects a mobile device preset (iPhone, Android, etc.) from the popup, TypeLess rewrites the User-Agent, Sec-CH-UA-Mobile, and Sec-CH-UA-Platform headers for that tab only, allowing the user to see how a web form renders on a mobile browser. No network traffic is intercepted, logged, or redirected.
